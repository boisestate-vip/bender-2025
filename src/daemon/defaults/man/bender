.SH NAME
bender \- manage operations on the bender robot
.SH SYNOPSIS
bender [-h] [-v] [-r] [-c command] [-d] [-C] [-f file] [-n name] [-p port] [-k keypath]
.SH DESCRIPTION
bender is a tool for interfacing with the bender system daemon, which allows users to issue 
commands to all machines on the bender robot at the same time. Commands are sent by the tool,
executed remotely by the associated daemon, and the first 2048 characters of the printed output 
is then returned to the tool as output. The tool
will hang and must be exited via SIGINT (^C). This allows the command to delay until
all messages have been collected. Because of the use of remote execution in
this system, messages are encrypted using the GOST 28147-89 cipher described in RFC 5830, provided
that a key file named 'key' is placed in the /etc/bender directory. See magma(1) 
for information on key generation. 
.SH CONFIGURATION
The follow files are used for configuration. They are listed below
.TP
\fB/etc/bender/cmd.conf\fR
Command configuration file. Specifies which commands the daemon and tool will respond to,
and what actions they will take. See bender.config(7) for information on the format of 
this file
.TP
\fB/etc/bender/daemon.conf\fR
Daemon configuration file. Specifies information related to the ros2 and bender installation
on the system. These values will have been set on install and should likely not be edited. The
default socket (47600) is specified here as the socket for the daemon to listen on.
.TP
\fB/etc/bender/key\fR
Key file. See magma(1) for info on key generation. This file does not have to be provided, as
the system will operate via plaintext messages otherwise. If a key is provided, messages will
be sent encrypted with a randomly generated nonce using gost's CF cipher mode. They will be 
sent with a MAC of the pre-encrypted message, and the MAC will be checked on message decryption.
Plaintext messages will be ignored when a key is loaded, and encrypted messages will be ignored
if no key is provided. See RFC 5830 for a description of the GOST cipher.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
\fB\-h\fR
Print a help message, then exit
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Print version information
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Issue a reset command to all active daemons. This results in an attempted reloading of key 
and configuration files. If there is an error reloading, the daemeon will fall back to the 
previous values.
.TP
\fB\-c [command]\fR
Send the provided command to all active daemons. This command must be specified in the
command config file in order for it to be used by the daemon and the tool.
.TP
\fB\-d [command]\fR
Print all commands the tool has loaded. Useful for debugging.
.TP
\fB\-C [command]\fR
Check the command config file for errors, printing the locations where errors
have occured in the file.
.TP
\fB\-f [command]\fR
Specify an alternative path for the command configuration file. Note that the file
the daemon reads from is not affected by this choice and issues may occur if these
files do not match.
.TP
\fB\-n [name]\fR
Specify the host to target. Only bender installs with the given name will respond
to this message. Passed to the daemon on startup.
.TP
\fB\-p [name]\fR
Specify a port to send to that differs from the default port (47600).
.TP
\fB\-k [keypath]\fR
Specify a key file that differs from the default key path. Note that this does
not change the key currently in use by the running daemons.
.SH SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
The author will note that they are not a security expert and do not vouch for
the security of this system. Do not allow this daemon to be installed on an
untrusted network, as it could allow for remote execution of arbitrary commands
by a bad actor.
