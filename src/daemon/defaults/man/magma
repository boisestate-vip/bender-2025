.SH NAME
magma \- invoke the GOST cipher
.SH SYNOPSIS
magma [-e | -d | -m | -g] [-k file] [-v] [-V] [-h] [-n nonce] [-f,-i file] [-o file] [-M mode] [-K] [-P] [-R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Implimentation of the GOST 28147-89 cipher as described in RFC 5830 and ГОСТ Р 34.12─2015. Functionality
for key generation, MAC generation, ECB, CE, and CF cipher modes are supported. Allows for encryption and
decryption of files and piping between stdin and stout. If multiple modes are provided results are
unspecified. Default input is stdin, default output is stdout. Default mode is ECB. Trailing null bytes in
final block (8 bytes) is culled during decryption by default.
.PP
The files ./gost.key, ~/.gost/gost.key, /etc/gost.key will be checked (in that order) for a key if no
key is provided to the command.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
\fB\-h\fR
Print a help message, then exit
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Print version information
.TP
\fB\-e\fR
Run in encryption mode (default). Accepts a file from input, encrypts it, and places the result in output.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Run in decryption mode. Accepts a file from input, decrypts it, and places the result in output.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR
Run in MAC mode. Accepts a file from input and prints the MAC to stdout.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR
Run in key generation mode. Generates a key and places the result in output.
.TP
\fB\-k [file]\fR
Loads a key from the given file. Key must have the required header and footer displayed in key 
generation to be found. Key can be placed in a file of arbitrary size.
.TP
\fB\-n [nonce]\fR
Use a nonce in encryption. Sets the mode to CF if no other mode is specified.
.TP
\fB\-f, \-i [file]\fR
Provide a file as input. 
.TP
\fB\-o [file]\fR
Provide a file as output. Previous contents of file will be overridden. 
.TP
\fB\-M [mode]\fR
Set the mode of the cipher. Options are ECB (electronic code book), CE (counter encryption), 
and CF (cipher feedback). Counter encryption and cipher feedback modes require a nonce, which
will be zero if none is specified.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR
Run in verbose mode. Additional output will be printed at all steps.
.TP
\fB\-K\fR
Print the path of the key being used.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR
Preserve the trailing null bytes in the final decryption block (8 bytes). The bytes are removed by
default to ensure that the file size will be the same on input and output. If the trailing \\0 bytes
need to be preserved, specify this flag.
.TP
\fB\-K\fR
Print whether this build of magma was compiled with the rdrand x86/arm64 instruction. This instruction
samples from hardware to produce true randomness, and as a result is a safe source of key generation. If
the build is compiled without rdrand, the c call random() call is used to generate keys, with the seed being
the c call srandom(time()*clock()). Use of this tool for key generation is discouraged if rdrand is not
avaliable.
